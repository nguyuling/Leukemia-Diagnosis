# The Computational Quest for Precision in Leukemia Diagnosis

<br>

## 🎯 Mission: Precision in Blood Cancer Diagnosis

The term "__leukemia__" covers a spectrum of devastating blood cancers, but not all leukemias are the same. Misclassification leads to missed treatment windows and poor patient outcomes.

This project, developed for the __Programming for Bioinformatics__ course, tackles this critical challenge head-on. Using machine learning and public genomic data (gene expression profiles from the GSE13164 dataset) to build a robust, data-driven classifier.

The Goal: To accurately distinguish and predict the __four major leukemia subtypes__ based on their molecular signatures.

## 🛠️ The Pipeline: From Raw Data to Diagnostic Model

This repository contains the complete pipeline for multi-class classification:

1. __Data Wrangling__ : Cleaning and preprocessing raw microarray data.
>     data_wrangling.py
<br>

>     GSE13164_cleaned_features.csv
<br>

>     GSE13164_cleaned_labels.csv

2. __Exploratory Data Analysis__ : Identifying key genes showing differential expression across subtypes.

3. __Feature Selection__ : Reducing the feature space to a high-impact biomarker panel.

4. __Model Development__ & Evaluation : Training and optimizing classifiers (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression) using rigorous cross-validation to achieve high prediction accuracy.
